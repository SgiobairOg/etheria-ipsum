She knows everything about me, exactly what I'll do, exactly how to take me out.  They'll overwhelm Frosta and Mermista with bots , they'll fire on Perfuma  and use her to draw Bow out into the open, pinning him down between the bots and the Horde soldiers. Glimmer will teleport in to save him, but she won't have enough magic left to get out, trapping them both.  Catra will make me watch all of it before she finishes me off, and then everyone is gone, and the Horde wins the war, and Etheria crumbles, and it's all my fault!"

The weapon can't hurt anyone else here. I saw what they would do...the deaths that would follow...I couldn't stop them before, but I can now. Hiding is our only option.  Adora...this isn't over. The Heart of Etheria is  siphoning magic, storing it. It's unstable, it will tear Etheria apart if it goes off again.  So it's up to you now. I couldn't stop it. In the end, I wasn't strong enough. But youAdora, you will be more powerful than they ever planned.  Adora...I believe in you. You can save the world we love."
