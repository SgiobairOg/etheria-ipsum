The Rebellion is losing worse than ever, and Glimmer-I need to find another way to help the Rebellion. I know we can still win this. There was something Mara said in her message--she talked about...some kind of weapon.  ...You  know something. If there's some kind of First Ones weapon out there, you need to tell me! We could use it to defeat the Horde, and free Etheria, and then Glimmer would finally see that she was wrong about-- ...What was that for?\""],"653":["\"You want to know what I am; I am a clone! A clone of the emperor of the known universe, Horde Prime Horde Prime cloned himself, building an army to conquer all he saw. Planets, worlds, galaxies fell before us. I was his top general, but there was a defect in my cloning, and defects are worthless to Prime. I was sent to die on the front lines, but during battle, a portal opened and sent me crashing to Etheria, stranding me here. With nothing but a broken ship, I built an empire. When my portal opens, I shall bring forth my brother's armies to crush The Rebellion, and Horde Prime will see that he was wrong. I am not a defect. I am worth something!\""],"669":["\"You wanna know the worst that could happen? Fine I'm the heaviest hitter, so Catra will separate me right away. Trap me, take my sword, do .

They'll overwhelm Frosta and Mermista with bots , they'll fire on Perfuma  and use her to draw Bow out into the open, pinning him down between the bots and the Horde soldiers. Glimmer will teleport in to save him, but she won't have enough magic left to get out, trapping them both.  Catra will make me watch all of it before she finishes me off, and then everyone is gone, and the Horde wins the war, and Etheria crumbles, and it's all my fault!\""],"695":["\"I opened a portal to a completely empty dimension and pulled Etheria in I hid us from the rest of the universe, to keep everyone safe.
